	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm. It helps us understand how the time taken by an algorithm increases with the size of the input. Algorithms are considered efficient if they have a lower time complexity.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. For example, an algorithm with a linear space complexity is denoted as O(n). <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial for optimizing resource usage.</p>
